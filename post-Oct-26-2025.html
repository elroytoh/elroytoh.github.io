        <p>
          The past three months have been pretty eventful — and honestly, filled with a lot of personal growth.
          I graduated, started my first job, and moved out to live on my own. Big changes all around.
        </p>

        <h2>🎓 Graduation</h2>
        <p>
          Back in 2019, when I got my A-level results, university felt like a faraway dream. My grades weren’t great, and getting into a local uni seemed almost impossible. 
          I still remember going to my close friend’s house that day, telling him how scared I was about my future.
        </p>
        <p>
          That first year, all my friends already had university offers — and I was just… waiting. Trying. Hoping. During NS, I took the SATs to give myself another shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward to 2020 — when the acceptance letter finally came, I felt pure relief. It wasn’t the “top” school, but it was my opportunity, and I was grateful for it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Graduation brought all those memories back — the long nights, the uncertainty, and how much I had to learn just to learn.
          It was a tough journey, but one I’ll always remember.
        </p>

        <h2>💼 Starting Out at UBS</h2>
        <p>
          Fresh out of university, I joined UBS as a treasury trader — my first real job. Honestly, I’m still a little amazed I get to do this. 
          The markets are intense, the learning curve is steep, and the people around me are razor-sharp.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clearing the FMRP exam was probably one of the hardest things I’ve done this year. I still remember Christy reminding me, 
          “Hey, your exam’s coming up,” and me saying, “It’s just MCQs, how bad can it be?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Well… it was bad. I failed twice before finally passing. It was humbling, but I learned a lot more from failing than I ever would have from breezing through it.
        </p>

        <h2>🏡 Moving Out</h2>
        <p>
          And then there’s moving out — probably the biggest emotional change of all.
          It’s something I’ve wanted for a long time — having my own space, figuring out how to live independently. 
          I never got to experience dorm life in uni or go on a long exchange, so this feels like my version of that.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s not perfect, but I love it. My place is near the sea, and on weekends I take short walks or runs along the coast. 
          There’s something peaceful about ending a long week with the sound of waves nearby.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s been a wild few months — a mix of challenges, gratitude, and a lot of growing up. 
          I’m learning to take things as they come, to be thankful for small wins, and to keep building — step by step.
