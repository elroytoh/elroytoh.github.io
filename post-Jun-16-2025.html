          In two weeks, I’ll be wrapping up my final internship at Temasek. Over the past few years, I’ve completed three internships — at SGX, BNP Paribas, and Temasek Holdings. Here are my key takeaways:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Internships are about people, not just knowledge:</strong>  
            As a Global Markets intern, I realized the real value lies in finding the right mentors and making meaningful connections. These professionals, typically 3–5 years ahead of you, don’t expect you to contribute immediately. What they look for is attitude: being hardworking, curious, and professional. Building relationships allows you to ask better questions and grow in the long term.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Prioritize what matters most to you:</strong>  
            I often chose not to socialize with other interns. While this can be seen as antisocial, I felt it gave full-time employees the impression that I was serious and focused. Staying present at your desk allows you to pick up more responsibilities and seize spontaneous learning opportunities.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Have a long-term goal and keep reviewing it:</strong>  
            If your goal is to become a trader, consistently ask yourself which short-term tasks or skills can get you closer. Internships are stepping stones; make sure each one aligns with your broader career direction.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Every internship is different, shaped by the team, culture, and role. The key is adaptability — adjusting your behavior and communication style to make the most of each experience.
